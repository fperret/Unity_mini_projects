3D version of the Tetris game with mecanisms inspired from FEZ.

Same goal as the original game but the orthogonal projection allows line completion by viewing from one side to another.

Aborted because I did not find a way to use this mechanism :
* if usable at will, the player had nothing to gain by using it
* if imposed by the game it becomes complicated to predict the next move

Controls

    R - Rotate
    Q - Left move
    D - Right move
    G - Fast fall
    Space - Instant fall
    Return - Store / trade
    M - Mute
